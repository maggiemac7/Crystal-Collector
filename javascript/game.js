// Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.

// When they do click one, update the player's score counter.
// Score counter adding together value of crystals clicked

// The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
// Score +1 if score counter === random number

// Game resets if score counter === random numbers

// The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
// Loss score +1 is score counter > random number

// Game resets if score counter > random number

// The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
// Game reset generates all new random numbers
// Game reset resets score counter to 0

// When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

// The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
